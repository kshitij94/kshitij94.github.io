        three infrared emitter-receiver pair and an NPN phototransistor. The sensor detects reflected infrared light,
        enabling the detection of surface reflectivity variations (light/dark, color) and proximity. Three independent
        sensors are employed, each providing an analog output corresponding to the reflected light intensity. By reading
        these analog values via the Arduino's analog input pins, we can determine which sensor(s) are detecting the
        black line. This information is then used to implement a line-following algorithm, controlling the robot's
        motors to maintain the desired trajectory.

        This project utilizes the <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Tracking-Ultrasonic-Intelligent-Educational/dp/B07KPZ8RSZ">ELEGOO robo
          kit</a>, which includes an Arduino microcontroller and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor sensors.
        The principle of ultrasonic distance measurement is that

        the transmitter emits ultrasonic waves in a certain direction and starts

        timing at the same time of the launch moment. The ultrasonic waves travel

        through the air and returns immediately when encountering obstacles.

        Then the ultrasonic receiver stops timing immediately when receiving the

        reflected waves. According to the recorded time and the known condition

        that ultrasonic propagation speed in the air is 340m/s, the distance between

        the ultrasonic module and the obstacle can be obtained.

        While moving, the car actively checks for obstacles within 30 cm. Upon detection, it uses a servo to sweep the
        ultrasonic sensor left and right, then turns to the clear path and proceeds.

      <h1 class="my-heading">Forward Kinematic with 2 DOF Arm</h1>
      <p class="lead-para">
        Goal was to master 3D printing and core ROS concepts, including controllers, URDF, and launch files, through the
        hands-on development of a 2-DOF robotic arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project focused on the design and implementation of a 2-DOF robotic arm, emphasizing practical application
        of 3D printing and core Robot Operating System (ROS) functionalities.

        The arm's mechanical structure was designed in SolidWorks and precision-fabricated using a Prusa 3D printer.
        Critical to assembly was the accurate measurement of components like SG90 servos, necessitating the use of
        calipers for precise fitment.

        Subsequently, attention shifted to ROS for robotic control. Leveraging ROS, the SolidWorks model was imported,
        and URDF files were generated to define the arm's kinematic structure (joints and links). ROS controllers were
        then employed to command joint movements. The project specifically focused on forward kinematics: translating
        user-input joint angles into physical movements. This involved serial communication (C++) between ROS and an
        Arduino, which actuated the arm's motors.

        While lacking AI, the project demonstrated the arm's capability to execute predefined, hardcoded paths,
        analogous to applications like automated painting. rViz proved indispensable for simulating the arm's behavior
        and debugging control algorithms prior to deployment on the physical hardware.

      <p class="lead-para">
        Before designing and 3D printing an full scale 6DOF robotic arm, I wanted to see if the Inverse kinematics works
        on a simulated arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created a 6DOF arm and setup the moveit packages. Then i wrote a client that would instruct moveit grp node to
        position the end effector to
        hardcoded location. Few learnings are moveit OMPL planner only works with 6+ DOF arm. Another learning was
        optimal arm design is adjacent joints must have perpendicular axis of rotation.

      <h1 class="my-heading">3D printing a gear box</h1>
      <p class="lead-para">
        Standard stepper motors are characterized by high speed but low torque, which is often the opposite of what a
        robotic arm requires.
        By integrating a gearbox, you can exchange that excess speed for significantly higher torque and smoother, more
        controlled motion.
        This mechanical advantage is essential for achieving the precision and lifting capacity necessary for robotic
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to design a cycloidal drive because it is easy to 3D print and offers virtually zero backlash or jitter.
        With a 21:1 reduction ratio, the drive effectively converts the stepper motor's 59 Ncm of torque into an output
        of 130 Ncm. While a 21:1 ratio requires 21 full motor rotations for every single output rotation, this
        mechanical
        advantage provides the precision and strength necessary for high-accuracy applications.
